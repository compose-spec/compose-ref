This repository hosts the reference implementation for the Compose
specification. The purpose of this implementation is to provide a tool for
Compose specification contributors to test changes to the specification and a
code example for Compose specification implementers to understand how to
implement the specification. It is not intended to be used 'as is' by end users
or in production.
